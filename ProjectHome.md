Termineter is a framework written in python to provide a platform for the security testing of smart meters.  It implements the C12.18 and C12.19 protocols for communication.  Currently supported are Meters using C12.19 with 7-bit character sets.  Termineter communicates with Smart Meters via a connection using an ANSI type-2 optical probe with a serial interface.

The latest version of Termineter is now hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/securestate/termineter)
